Ocean's Eleven Team Retrospective
For our CMPE 202 project this semester, we decided to build a Javascript game called "Fat Cat". Our game revolves around our main character, a cat, which must stay "healthy" by avoiding unhealthy foods in order to complete the game. If the cat eats too many unhealthy foods, the speed and acceleration levels of the cat decrease, making it harder to conquer obstacles that it may face.
