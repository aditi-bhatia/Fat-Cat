#Phaser Game Engine Research

Phaser is an HTML5 game framework which aims to help developers make powerful, cross-browser HTML5 games really quickly and, unlike some others, has solely been built to work with the mobile browsers as well. The only browser requirement is the support of the canvas tag.
