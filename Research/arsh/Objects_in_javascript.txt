- Javascript mianly has two type of variables:

1. Primitives: no properties or methods
2. Objects: simply named values or mianly


- Objects in javascript are like Hashmaps in java:

- There are different ways to create new objects:
	-	Define and create a single object, using an object literal:
				var person = {firstName:"Arshdeep", lastName:"Singh", age:26}; 
		
	-	Define and create a single object, with the keyword new.
				var person = new Object();
				person.firstName = "Arshdeep";
				person.lastName = "Singh";
				person.age = 26;
	
	-	Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type. 
				function person(first, last, age) {
			    this.firstName = first;
			    this.lastName = last;
			    this.age = age;
				}
				var me = new person("Arshdeep", "Singh", 26);
				
				

- Unlike java you can add or remove properties from object:
			- if object exists:
				person.nationality = "India";
				
			- delete person.age;
			
			
			
- Javascript prototypes:
	
	- Every JavaScript object has a prototype. 
	- Inherit from the Object.prototype
	- Prototype are created using constructor functions

	- Adding a property or method to existing object(Not prototype):
			me.name = function () {
   			return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
			}; 
	- Adding property to prototype:
		-	add in constructor
	
	- Prototype property
		- 	Person.prototype.nationality = "Indian";
