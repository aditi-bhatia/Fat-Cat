*Project Ideas (references)*

1. Mario game in Javascript + HTML5. Inspiration: http://mario5.florian-rappl.de/#game
	-Normal Mario game, but can be modified with new levels/monsters.

2. Facial expressions game (popular on Facebook): 
	-A user "wins" by making the same facial expressions the game displays, with increasing difficulty and speed. 
	
3. Augmented reality (AR) Sudoku solver. 
	-Upload an image of any Sudoku puzzle (or display one in front of the computer’s camera), and the application will solve the puzzle for you in real-time. Results will be displayed on the puzzle’s image itself with augmented reality.

4. Betting application. 
	-Two (or more) users can place bets on events/game results through the application. 


*Javascript Libraries*

1. Recommended computer vision Javascript library: https://trackingjs.com/
	-TrackingJS: Offers a variety of computer vision algorithms, from facial expression detection (useful for idea #2 above), color detection, feature descriptor, and can be used for both image and video formats. This would also be helpful for idea #3, the augmented reality Sudoku app.

2. Recommended audio Javascript library: http://createjs.com/soundjs
	-SoundJS: Abstracts HTML5 sound implementation, which allows for game audio experiences to be consistent on cross-browsers.

3. Recommended asset-loading Javascript library: http://createjs.com/preloadjs
	-PreloadJS: Easy to manage when assets and data are loaded within the game, with multiple queues.
