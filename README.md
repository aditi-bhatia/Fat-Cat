## Adopted Agile practices:
Our team has adopted the following Agile practices:

* Iterations: Weekly sprints.
* Continuous Integration: Code is integrated after every feature.
* Frequent Releases: Code is in a shippable state after every week.
* Collective Ownership: No person is alloted single module.
