# XP Core Value: Feedback
## Week 1
### Sept. 18, Monday
Setup GitHub repository with Agile Taskboard to keep the team organized and aware of feedback and result outputs.
### Sept. 19, Tuesday
Met with team and discussed project ideas and to-do tasks. We provided feedback to one another while discussing project ideas, and this allowed us to make improvements to the ideas we had.
### Sept. 20, Wednesday
Researched existing implementations of the project ideas we had, as well as recommended libraries (for features such as facial recognition). Discussed what already exists and how we can use this to create our own versions of the games. Feedback from the internet from what people have created in the past and what they've had issues with allowed me to see what potential difficulties our team could have. Wrote the Weekly Minutes for Week 1 and added to the team wiki to keep team updated on all feedback and communication from the previous meeting.
### Sept. 21, Thursday
Continued researching implementation of our project ideas + libraries in order to decide which idea would be best. Like before, feedback from the internet and from previous users allowed me to see what issues we could potentially face.
### Sept. 22, Friday
Began finishing up research on project ideas, libraries, and game engines, and read about feedback from other developers about how many game engines (such as Unity) have issues with importing external javascript libraries--such as trackingJS for facial recognition. This feedback will help my team and I to choose the best suited game engine + library combination for the app we choose to do.

## Week 2
### Sept. 23, Saturday
Held our weekly team meeting and discussed project ideas. We each provided feedback on our top 3 choices for game ideas, and this feedback allowed us to pick the best game choice for our project. The feedback we provided to one another also helped us realize that we each needed to do research on game design patterns, so we created a task for each of us to research 1 game design pattern by next week. For next week's meeting, this will allow us to give feedback on which design pattern would be the best to use for our game design.
### Sept. 25, Monday
Created Google Doc to create a list of features that will be present in our game application. Using this collaborative document, we were able to work together and provide feedback to one another in terms of which features to add. I also began research on design patterns to gain familiarity with the topic and concepts.
### Sept. 26, Tuesday
Continued researching design patterns and studied some of the main patterns such as State, Singleton, Adapter, and Observer design patterns. The reason for this research is to be able to provide feedback to my team during our next meeting about with pattern we should use for our project.
### Sept. 27, Wednesday
Began building a sample Javascript web application to test features of the CLM face detection library. Also, continued working on researching design patterns.
### Sept. 28, Thursday
Continued work on the sample Javascript web application using the library and reviewed what feedback programmers had online about this library.
### Sept. 29, Friday
Completed my research document on the State design pattern, which I found most interesting and relevant to our project. In addition, found the best Java examples available online to demo and explain a State design pattern to my teammates, so that our discussion can have productive feedback and understanding about which pattern we should use. Discussed the demo sample Javascript web application using the CLM library with my teammates to hear their feedback regarding it.

## Week 3
### Sept. 30, Saturday
Held our weekly meeting and provided feedback on the current game we have chosen. We discussed the design patterns we researched, and provided feedback to the team regarding which design patterns would be the best for our game. Together, we worked to begin our detailed Specifications and Features document, which includes a preliminary list of features our game will have. This document was created so that we can all collaborate and provide feedback on the features of the game we have chosen, and also so that we can all be on the same page during development. We also discussed our familiarty with MelonJS, and found that most of us are unfamiliar with this game engine. Therefore, we decided that one of the main tasks of this week will be to set up the environment (as some of us were having issues with this), and have a sample game running and executing with the game engine.
### Oct. 1, Sunday
Began work on the MelonJS environment setup and sample game. Also continued to modify the Features list and created definitions and sample variables for each "object" in the game--so the team could get a better idea of how our game will be structured.
### Oct. 2, Monday
Continued work on the MelonJS environment and started writing code for the sample game. The sample game I will be implementing is "Space Invaders", which is a classic game that should be fairly straightforward to implement (based on the feedback from other developers online). 
### Oct. 4, Wednesday
Ran into some issues with the sample game and followed tutorials online to fix the errors I was getting. Feedback from developers online helped resolve the setup issues I had with my game, and I continued developing the game. Also, communicated with my team regarding the design of our game, which we will continue working on after everyone is familiar with MelonJS. Discussed potential design patterns for our "Fat Cat" game (new game title will soon be developed - it is a work in progress), and agreed to research other game similar to our game for design pattern inspiration.
### Oct. 5, Thursday
Continued work on MelonJS "Space Invaders" game.
### Oct. 6, Friday
Continued work on game, and also designed sample mockups of game UI. Sample mockups include the start of the game, where the cat/chosen character has not begun its journey yet, the cat/character eating an "unhealthy" object such as a milkshake and losing speed and health, the cat/character arriving at a "healthy" object such as a salad and gaining speed and health. Of course, in future mock-ups, the speed and health values will be more calibrated towards the character and the items eaten. Additionally, character and background development will be more visually appealing in future releases -- along with more details and screen shots of specific events in the game. Future feedback from the team and other people we show this game in development to will be noted and implemented in other releases.
## Week 4
### Oct. 7, Saturday
Meeting with team to discuss current progress and provide feedback on progress so far. Based on team feedback, we have decided to continue working on the sample game in the MelonJS environment for the upcoming week as well, since we do not feel adequately comfortable with the environment yet. We will also need to look into making our game with Tiled functionality in order to achieve the "Mario-like" effect of character movement.
### Oct. 9, Monday
Continued work on MelonJS "Space Invaders" game.
### Oct. 11, Wednesday
Added additional features and looked further into the Tiled functionality in Javascript/MelonJS.
### Oct. 14, Saturday
Had our weekly team meeting to discuss progress from last week (which was less than most weeks, comparatively, due to the midterm). Due to the short past week, we will continue working on the sample demo as well as the Use Cases document and the Features Document.
### Oct. 17, Tuesday
Debugged issues in my sample game based off of feedback from developers online. Other people's previous experiences helped me learn more about the game development process and helped me gain some insight in the errors I was making.
### Oct. 18, Wednesday
Researched design patterns and concluded that the Decorator Design pattern + the State Design pattern would be the best options for the project. I believe these would be good choices because each interface in our project will have multiple small attributes which will have important attributes that need to change.
### Oct. 19, Thursday and Oct. 20, Friday
Continued research on design patterns and began designing a sample UML diagram, based on feedback from team and learning materials. Finished work on the sample Space Invaders game and pushed code. Updated the Features Document with clarifications and design patterns.
## Week 5
### Oct. 21, Saturday
Team meeting was held and we worked together and provided feedback on things that need to get done. 
### Oct. 23, Monday

### Oct. 24, Tuesday
