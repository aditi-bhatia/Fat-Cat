# XP Core Value: Feedback
## Week 1
### Sept. 18, Monday
Setup GitHub repository with Agile Taskboard to keep the team organized and aware of feedback and result outputs.
### Sept. 19, Tuesday
Met with team and discussed project ideas and to-do tasks. We provided feedback to one another while discussing project ideas, and this allowed us to make improvements to the ideas we had.
### Sept. 20, Wednesday
Researched existing implementations of the project ideas we had, as well as recommended libraries (for features such as facial recognition). Discussed what already exists and how we can use this to create our own versions of the games. Feedback from the internet from what people have created in the past and what they've had issues with allowed me to see what potential difficulties our team could have. Wrote the Weekly Minutes for Week 1 and added to the team wiki to keep team updated on all feedback and communication from the previous meeting.
### Sept. 21, Thursday
Continued researching implementation of our project ideas + libraries in order to decide which idea would be best. Like before, feedback from the internet and from previous users allowed me to see what issues we could potentially face.
### Sept. 22, Friday
Began finishing up research on project ideas, libraries, and game engines, and read about feedback from other developers about how many game engines (such as Unity) have issues with importing external javascript libraries--such as trackingJS for facial recognition. This feedback will help my team and I to choose the best suited game engine + library combination for the app we choose to do.

## Week 2
### Sept. 23, Saturday
Held our weekly team meeting and discussed project ideas. We each provided feedback on our top 3 choices for game ideas, and this feedback allowed us to pick the best game choice for our project. The feedback we provided to one another also helped us realize that we each needed to do research on game design patterns, so we created a task for each of us to research 1 game design pattern by next week. For next week's meeting, this will allow us to give feedback on which design pattern would be the best to use for our game design.

### Sept. 25, Monday
Created Google Doc to create a list of features that will be present in our game application. Using this collaborative document, we were able to work together and provide feedback to one another in terms of which features to add. I also began research on design patterns to gain familiarity with the topic and concepts.

### Sept. 26, Tuesday
Continued researching design patterns and studied some of the main patterns such as State, Singleton, Adapter, and Observer design patterns. The reason for this research is to be able to provide feedback to my team during our next meeting about with pattern we should use for our project.
### Sept. 27, Wednesday
Began building a sample Javascript web application to test features of the CLM face detection library. Also, continued working on researching design patterns.
### Sept. 28, Thursday
Continued work on the sample Javascript web application using the library and reviewed what feedback programmers had online about this library.
### Sept. 29, Friday
Completed my research document on the State design pattern, which I found most interesting and relevant to our project. In addition, found the best Java examples available online to demo and explain a State design pattern to my teammates, so that our discussion can have productive feedback and understanding about which pattern we should use. Discussed the demo sample Javascript web application using the CLM library with my teammates to hear their feedback regarding it.
## Week 3

### Sept. 30, Saturday
