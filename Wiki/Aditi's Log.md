# XP Core Value: Feedback
## Week 1
### Sept. 18, Monday
Setup GitHub repository with Agile Taskboard to keep the team organized and aware of feedback and result outputs.
### Sept. 19, Tuesday
Met with team and discussed project ideas and to-do tasks. We provided feedback to one another while discussing project ideas, and this allowed us to make improvements to the ideas we had.
### Sept. 20, Wednesday
Researched existing implementations of the project ideas we had, as well as recommended libraries (for features such as facial recognition). Discussed what already exists and how we can use this to create our own versions of the games. Feedback from the internet from what people have created in the past and what they've had issues with allowed me to see what potential difficulties our team could have. Wrote the Weekly Minutes for Week 1 and added to the team wiki to keep team updated on all feedback and communication from the previous meeting.
### Sept. 21, Thursday
Continued researching implementation of our project ideas + libraries in order to decide which idea would be best. Like before, feedback from the internet and from previous users allowed me to see what issues we could potentially face.
### Sept. 22, Friday
Began finishing up research on project ideas, libraries, and game engines, and read about feedback from other developers about how many game engines (such as Unity) have issues with importing external javascript libraries--such as trackingJS for facial recognition. This feedback will help my team and I to choose the best suited game engine + library combination for the app we choose to do.

## Week 2
### Sept. 23, Saturday
Held our weekly team meeting and discussed project ideas. We each provided feedback on our top 3 choices for game ideas, and this feedback allowed us to pick the best game choice for our project. The feedback we provided to one another also helped us realize that we each needed to do research on game design patterns, so we created a task for each of us to research 1 game design pattern by next week. For next week's meeting, this will allow us to give feedback on which design pattern would be the best to use for our game design.
### Sept. 25, Monday
Created Google Doc to create a list of features that will be present in our game application. Using this collaborative document, we were able to work together and provide feedback to one another in terms of which features to add. I also began research on design patterns to gain familiarity with the topic and concepts.
### Sept. 26, Tuesday
Continued researching design patterns and studied some of the main patterns such as State, Singleton, Adapter, and Observer design patterns. The reason for this research is to be able to provide feedback to my team during our next meeting about with pattern we should use for our project.
### Sept. 27, Wednesday
Began building a sample Javascript web application to test features of the CLM face detection library. Also, continued working on researching design patterns.
### Sept. 28, Thursday
Continued work on the sample Javascript web application using the library and reviewed what feedback programmers had online about this library.
### Sept. 29, Friday
Completed my research document on the State design pattern, which I found most interesting and relevant to our project. In addition, found the best Java examples available online to demo and explain a State design pattern to my teammates, so that our discussion can have productive feedback and understanding about which pattern we should use. Discussed the demo sample Javascript web application using the CLM library with my teammates to hear their feedback regarding it.

## Week 3
### Sept. 30, Saturday
Held our weekly meeting and provided feedback on the current game we have chosen. We discussed the design patterns we researched, and provided feedback to the team regarding which design patterns would be the best for our game. Together, we worked to begin our detailed Specifications and Features document, which includes a preliminary list of features our game will have. This document was created so that we can all collaborate and provide feedback on the features of the game we have chosen, and also so that we can all be on the same page during development. We also discussed our familiarty with MelonJS, and found that most of us are unfamiliar with this game engine. Therefore, we decided that one of the main tasks of this week will be to set up the environment (as some of us were having issues with this), and have a sample game running and executing with the game engine.
### Oct. 1, Sunday
Began work on the MelonJS environment setup and sample game. Also continued to modify the Features list and created definitions and sample variables for each "object" in the game--so the team could get a better idea of how our game will be structured.
### Oct. 2, Monday
Continued work on the MelonJS environment and started writing code for the sample game. The sample game I will be implementing is "Space Invaders", which is a classic game that should be fairly straightforward to implement (based on the feedback from other developers online). 
### Oct. 4, Wednesday
Ran into some issues with the sample game and followed tutorials online to fix the errors I was getting. Feedback from developers online helped resolve the setup issues I had with my game, and I continued developing the game. Also, communicated with my team regarding the design of our game, which we will continue working on after everyone is familiar with MelonJS. Discussed potential design patterns for our "Fat Cat" game (new game title will soon be developed - it is a work in progress), and agreed to research other game similar to our game for design pattern inspiration.
### Oct. 5, Thursday
Continued work on MelonJS "Space Invaders" game.
### Oct. 6, Friday
Continued work on game, and also designed sample mockups of game UI. Sample mockups include the start of the game, where the cat/chosen character has not begun its journey yet, the cat/character eating an "unhealthy" object such as a milkshake and losing speed and health, the cat/character arriving at a "healthy" object such as a salad and gaining speed and health. Of course, in future mock-ups, the speed and health values will be more calibrated towards the character and the items eaten. Additionally, character and background development will be more visually appealing in future releases -- along with more details and screen shots of specific events in the game. Future feedback from the team and other people we show this game in development to will be noted and implemented in other releases.
## Week 4
### Oct. 7, Saturday
Meeting with team to discuss current progress and provide feedback on progress so far. Based on team feedback, we have decided to continue working on the sample game in the MelonJS environment for the upcoming week as well, since we do not feel adequately comfortable with the environment yet. We will also need to look into making our game with Tiled functionality in order to achieve the "Mario-like" effect of character movement.
### Oct. 9, Monday
Continued work on MelonJS "Space Invaders" game.
### Oct. 11, Wednesday
Added additional features and looked further into the Tiled functionality in Javascript/MelonJS.
### Oct. 14, Saturday
Had our weekly team meeting to discuss progress from last week (which was less than most weeks, comparatively, due to the midterm). Due to the short past week, we will continue working on the sample demo as well as the Use Cases document and the Features Document.
### Oct. 17, Tuesday
Debugged issues in my sample game based off of feedback from developers online. Other people's previous experiences helped me learn more about the game development process and helped me gain some insight in the errors I was making.
### Oct. 18, Wednesday
Researched design patterns and concluded that the Decorator Design pattern + the State Design pattern would be the best options for the project. I believe these would be good choices because each interface in our project will have multiple small attributes which will have important attributes that need to change.
### Oct. 19, Thursday and Oct. 20, Friday
Continued research on design patterns and began designing a sample UML diagram, based on feedback from team and learning materials. Finished work on the sample Space Invaders game and pushed code. Updated the Features Document with clarifications and design patterns.
## Week 5
### Oct. 21, Saturday
Team meeting was held and we worked together and provided feedback on things that need to get done. I began work on a UML diagram with the specifics of each object, and began designing one with the following design patterns I found suitable: State, Factory Method, and Decorator. As a team, we worked together to get a demo working of the game, and we split the portions of work so that we could work on our parts individually.
### Oct. 23, Monday
Worked on creating an "end" to the game -- either when the character dies or when the game level is completed. Also worked to create a "pause" state to the game so that the player can pause the game and resume. Tested these functions and also worked on adding "pause" and "stop" buttons to the screen, but there were issues with the texture being used.
### Oct. 24, Tuesday
Spoke with my team member and we provided feedback to one another about difficulties we ran into while working on the game. We agreed to split up the issues and tackle them separately for more efficient results. I continued work on "end" game and created a HTML file that the player would be redirected to when the game ends.
### Oct. 25, Wednesday
Worked on modifying the formula for score calculation and also worked on "end" game sequence. Communicated with team and provided feedback about required a stop and pause button in the new texture we are generating.
### Oct. 26, Thursday
Continued work on end game sequence and developed buttons for "restart" or "quit" once the player reaches the end of the game. Communicated and provided feedback to other team members about having a "start up" splash screen for the game where I can also add the "exit" or "restart" game functionality.
### Oct. 27, Friday
After some issues, I was able to get the score and time needed to complete to display to the user. There are now 2 end game screens where the user can see their performance level and decide whether to continue on with the game. The functionality is there but the pages will need to look prettier -- which is something I can work on next week.
## Week 6
### Oct. 28, Saturday
Held a team meeting to discuss and provide feedback on current progress. We each discussed what we completed and did not complete last week, and assigned tasks for next week. Our goal to complete the main functionality of the game by this week and spend the rest of the weeks working on improving the code structure and design patterns. 
### Oct. 29, Sunday
Worked on creating an end game javascript page for when the player dies, time runs out, or the player completes all the levels in the game. Found new background images and worked on writing code for score calculation and end game screen buttons.
### Oct. 30, Monday
Continued working on end game javascript page and added more functionality to the buttons. Changed appearance of buttons and fixed positioning. Began debugging an issue with the end game screen loading and looked for feedback online to see how to fix the issue.
### Oct. 31, Tuesday
Began debugging code and found an issue with the Pause function of the timer. Worked on debugging and developing this feature, as well as adding new functionality to the end game screen. Was able to get restartGame() to work, and also added new backgrounds for each end game scenario: character dies, character does not complete game in time, or character completes all levels of the game within the time limit.
### Nov. 1st, Wednesday
I used feedback from replaying the game countless times to find more errors and issues with the code and design. I found that there was an error with loading the end game screen which was linked to a callback error within MelonJS. Using this feedback, I debugged the code to fix the bug. I also worked on implementing the Pause function of the timer. Modified button appearance and code as well for a better UI.
### Nov. 2nd, Thursday
I gave feedback to the team about the Pause function of the timer not working, and continued to improve it. I also worked on removing the extra entities on the end game screen, such as the timer and the health bar, so that the end game screen will look clean and organized. In addition, I made some fixes to the score calculation code and timer code. I also added new background images to the game to make the end game screens more entertaining for the game player.
### Nov. 3rd, Friday
Was able to implement the pause function of the timer and pause the timer so that it would not go below "0:00" and throw a NaN error. This was able to fix timing errors that were generated as the game was running. I also began working on an animated end game screen with GIFs and MP4s to make the game more appealing and attractive to players. In addition, I worked on trying to remove the extra objects (such as the timer and health bar) from the screen, as well as fix the callback reload error. 
## Week 7
### Nov. 4th, Saturday
Continued work on removing extra objects (timer and health bar) from end game screen and debugging of callback reload, based off of feedback from playing the game multiple times. As a team, we all provided feedback to one another about the game's progress and brainstormed the required steps for the upcoming week.
### Nov. 6th, Monday
Brainstormed design patterns that could be used in different aspects of the game and how to implement them. Looked online for examples of design patterns and studied them to get a better idea and feedback from other people who have done the same. Began overviewing the code to see where refactoring can take place.
### Nov. 7th, Tuesday
Began work on implementing the command design pattern for all aspects of the game where a state change is required. The command design pattern function I created has 3 inputs: method, state, and callback. The method can be either "set" or "change", the state is whichever state you want your state to be changed to, and the callback is the function you want to run once the state is changed/set.
### Nov. 8th, Wednesday
Continued work on the command design pattern code and also began debugging bugs in the game. From receiving feedback from the game after playing it multiple times, I noticed that there was a callback error that would appear on the console at the end of the game. I began debugging this error and found it was due to the HUD being destroyed incorrectly without a defined callback function. I modified the code to fix this error and worked on the command design pattern updates.
### Nov. 9th, Thursday
Debugged more issues in the game, such as the multiple flashes of the end game page at the end of the game. I modified the code and found it was due to unncessarily repetitive function calls which were causing the page to load 4 times instead of just once. I finished up the command design pattern code and successfully implemented it throughout the entire game.
### Nov. 10th, Friday
Found issues with the score updating and the incorrect score being printed on the screen. Fixed this issue and due to feedback from my partner, found that there were issues with the end page for Time Up. Debugged this error and found it was due to a callback issue related to the command design pattern. Also, added new code for the Leaderboard so that a pop-up screen appears instead of text on the screen so that the UI looks cleaner. Future work will be needed to fix the leaderboard code with regards to saving the high scores as well as with the timer speeding up every time the "Restart" button is clicked. 
## Week 8
### Nov. 11th, Saturday
Continued debugging of game issues and brainstormed a list for what else is rest in the game. As a team, we provided each other feedback about what our game is still having issues with, and what else is left to do within the upcoming short timeframe. Looked over the team deliverables we have left for the project and assigned the remaining to every body.
### Nov. 13th, Monday
Began work on the Use Case deliverable as well as finding and fixing other remaining bugs in the game. Did some research online and reviewed the class's previous lecture notes for the correct format and guidelines for a User Story and began developing some. Created a structure for the other deliverables and assigned deliverables to teammates.
### Nov. 14th, Tuesday
Continued work on the Use Case deliverable and found that the Restart button in the game would speed up the timer everytime it was pressed. Due to this, the amount of actual time a user was able to play would continue decreasing after every restart. Provided feedback to my team to get this bug fixed.
### Nov. 15th, Wednesday
Began debugging issue with the leaderboard where new values were not being updated or saved. Provided feedback to my team about this issue so that we can work on it to get it resolved. Refactored the end game code so that it is easier to read and understand.
### Nov. 17th, Friday
Continued work on Use Cases and also began work on the UML Class Diagram that we will be working on as a team. Currently, we are waiting for all the design patterns to be implemented by the rest of the team so that we can provide feedback on these and then work on all diagrams for our final presentation. Also, began brainstorming ideas for our extra credit project video that we will be filiming soon.
