# Weekly Meeting-5
Held at: October 19th, 2:00PM

## What did the team do last week?


## What is the team going to do next week?
This week, we will be working on a multitude of areas in order to get our demo up and running. First off, we will be working to find good sprite characters and objects, and using these to create textures for our game. We will use these sprites as our main character and will also have the sprites include "enemies" and "good things". In addition, we will have to figure out a way to end the game, display the score, and provide the user options to restart or exit the game. We will also work on creating the menu for the start of the game, character collisions, and adding a game timer.

**Aditi:** End game when player dies or time runs out, update scoring mechanism, display score and time needed to complete at the end of the game, display options to restart or exit game.  

**Arshdeep:** Find character sprites and update character, "enemies", and "good things" with these sprite characters.

**Suhel:** Implement a timer in the game, which will be used for scoring and ending the game.

**Dishant:** Work on updating character collisions.

**Dipro:**  Work on creating a splash screen menu.

## What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?


## Next meeting is scheduled for: Saturday, October 28th 2017
