# Weekly Meeting-6
Held at: October 28th, 3:00PM

## What did the team do last week?
In the last week, we completed the following tasks:

1. Created new textures and spritesheets.
2. Design and implement splash screen for starting and create menu options for game start page. 
3. Completed the velocity change functionality on character collsions.
4. Implemented the timer functionality for the game.
5. Implemented different ways to end the game.
6. Updated the scoring mechanism and the score display in HUDDesign the initial screen and provide a GUI menu to start the game. 

## What is the team going to do next week?
For this upcoming week, we will be working on completing all major functionality of the game. This includes an animated health bar, longer maps for the character to traverse, a leaderboard, 3 end game screens for each end game scenario, character selection, and editted character images. We will be working together to ensure that all of these tasks are complete by the end of this week.

**Aditi:** Will work on creating 3 end game javascript files: one for the character "dying", the other for the character running out of time before finishing the game, and the third for the character "winning" by completing the entire game within the time limit. Will also work on updating the timer's "pause" and removing all objects that appear on the end screen but must not be visible.

**Suhel:** Will work on character selection buttons on splash start screen, addition of a scoreboard/leaderboard. The initial screen should display the leader board with top three scores of the game.

**Dipro:** Will edit the character images to look "larger" or unhealthier to meet the game's needs and will replace all food items with more obvious healthy/unhealthy choices. Will also work on improving splash screen buttons and graphics.

**Arsh:** Will work on making the game map longer and progressively harder, with an end point to the game as it is currently in a loop. The maps need to be redisgned and implemented so that we can make the level more challenging and attractive for end users as per our timing constraints

**Dishant:** Will work on adding a health bar that changes appearance corresponding to the character's health level. We need to update health bar as well as scores on the game screen as cat takes healthy or unhealthy objects.

## What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?
The main problem this week is implementation of patterns in melonJS. MelonJS itslef has design petterns( Such as state pattern and observer pattern) implemented in it. So re-engineering the game with our patterns is breaking the game engine functionality. We need to find a better way to implement patterns in the game.

## Next meeting is scheduled for: Saturday, November 4th, 2017
