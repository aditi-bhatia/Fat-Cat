In the last week, we completed the following tasks:


## What is the team going to do next week?
For this upcoming week, we will be working on completing all major functionality of the game. This includes an animated health bar, longer maps for the character to traverse, a leaderboard, 3 end game screens for each end game scenario, character selection, and editted character images. We will be working together to ensure that all of these tasks are complete by the end of this week.

**Aditi:** Will work on creating 3 end game javascript files: one for the character "dying", the other for the character running out of time before finishing the game, and the third for the character "winning" by completing the entire game within the time limit. Will also work on updating the timer's "pause" and removing all objects that appear on the end screen but must not be visible.

**Suhel:** Will work on character selection buttons on splash start screen, addition of a scoreboard/leaderboard.

**Dipro:** Will edit the character images to look "larger" or unhealthier to meet the game's needs and will replace all food items with more obvious healthy/unhealthy choices. Will also work on improving splash screen buttons and graphics.

**Arsh:** Will work on making the game map longer and progressively harder, with an end point to the game as it is currently in a loop.

**Dishant:** Will work on adding a health bar that changes appearance corresponding to the character's health level. 

## What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?


## Next meeting is scheduled for: Saturday, November 4th, 2017
