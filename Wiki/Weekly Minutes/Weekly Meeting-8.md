# Weekly Meeting-8
Held at: Nov. 11th, 3:00PM

## What did the team do last week?
In the last week, we completed the following tasks:

1. Refactored the code to implement command design pattern to show screen changes.
2. Implemented iterator pattern for the leaderboard display.
3. Implemented the state pattern for the main character.
4. Implemented proxy pattern for object validation
5. Implemented changes in the main character's anatomy once it collides with an unhealthy or healthy object.
 
## What is the team going to do next week?
Next week, our primary focus will be on refactoring the code to refactor code to implement observer pattern and decorator pattern in the game. We will continue to fix bugs in the functionalities and pitch the final product for presentation. Furthermore, we need to start cleaning the code and start creating the documentation of the game . Every team member will pick one bug each and start creating the project deliverables. We will also add more healthy objects in the game and will render them on tilemaps.
 
**Aditi:**  Work on Use Cases document, refactor code for end game screens, debug leaderboard updating bug and other small bugs.

**Suhel:**   

**Dipro:**  Work on 

**Arsh:** Create a general healthy object entity and create two healthy objects from it. Start class diagram for the game and fix one of the bugs. 

**Dishant:**   
 

## What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?
This week we found some design flaws which leady to some unwanted behaviour in our game . We had to make design changes in order to keep the time and score consistent when player move from one level to another. The game is using some components of melon js engine, so we are not sure if we need to model melonJS objects in our UML diagrams like class diagram and sequence diagrams.

## Next meeting is scheduled for: Saturday, November 18th, 2017
