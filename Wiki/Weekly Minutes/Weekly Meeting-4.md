# Weekly Meeting-4
Held at: October 8th, 12:00PM and October 14th, 3:30PM

## What did the team do last week?
As part of project research, team completed the following tasks:

1. MelonJS tutorials to test environment:
All team members set up the MelonJS environment and started following the online tutorials to veryify that setup is working for all of us. We ran into issues and resolved by mutual co-ordination. 

2. Refinement of features:
We started refining the features for our game and try to align everything to our requirments. We collaborated to define the system so that we can move on two next phase from next week. 

3. Es6 in javascript:
The team worked on using es6 and created design patterns in java script to get the fair idea on how to implement class heirarchy in it. Samples are checked in the repository.

3. Collaboration of knowledge:
As every team member had a different task, we created documents for cross references and helping other to cope up.
Last week, we tested our environment to see a common code base is runnig on every system. Team continued with practicing object orineted programming in ES6 as all researched the idea of using es6 as it has better support for creating classes.

## What is the team going to do next week?
This week, we will keep working on developing a sample game with MelonJS to get used to the environment and practices. We will also be working on adding more features to our Features Document and documenting these changes. We have identified different components in our game and will create component diagram for the system. We will create first basic version of our game this week.

**Aditi:**  Continue development with MelonJS, add more features to Features Document, work on Use Cases document.

**Arshdeep:** Lets start learning the TILED tool so that we can kick start the game design. Lets us see how to divide the game in different components. 

**Suhel:** Continue the devlopment of the sample and get familiarised with all the tools and kick start our design.

**Dishant:** Lets look more in the object oriented aspect of javascript and see if we can use patterns well in it. We will need to define the game flow as well.

**Dipro:**  Continue devlopment in MelonJs and see if we can use es6 in it. Lets decide if we can stick with this es6 or need to work on es5.

## What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?
Javascript is object functional but to implement design patterns in object oriented aspect. There are several pieces missing in javascript(Example Intyerface, enums) which are heavily used in patterns. We are not sure if design in java script will include those or not. 

## Next meeting is scheduled for: Saturday, October 21st 2017
