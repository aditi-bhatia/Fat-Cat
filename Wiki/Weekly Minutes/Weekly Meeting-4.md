# Weekly Meeting-4
Held at: October 8th, 12:00PM and October 14th, 3:30PM

## What did the team do last week?
Last week, we all set up our MelonJS environment and began developing sample games based off of tutorials online. Everybody was able to render images, sound and objects on screen using the sample tutorial. Team continued with practicing object orineted programming in javascript. We all researched the idea of using es6 as it has better support for creating classes.
## What is the team going to do next week?
This week, we will keep working on developing a sample game with MelonJS to get used to the environment and practices. We will also be working on adding more features to our Features Document and documenting these changes.

**Aditi:**  Continue development with MelonJS, add more features to Features Document, work on Use Cases document.

**Arshdeep:** Lets start learning the TILED tool so that we can kick start the game design. Lets us see how to divide the game in different components. 

**Suhel:** Continue the devlopment of the sample and get familiarised with all the tools and kick start our design.

**Dishant:** Lets look more in the object oriented aspect of javascript and see if we can use patterns well in it. We will need to define the game flow as well.

**Dipro:**  Continue devlopment in MelonJs and see if we can use es6 in it. Lets decide if we can stick with this es6 or need to work on es5.

## What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?
Javascript is object functional but to implement design patterns in object oriented aspect. There are several pieces missing in javascript(Example Intyerface, enums) which are heavily used in patterns. We are not sure if design in java script will include those or not 

## Next meeting is scheduled for: Saturday, October 21st 2017
