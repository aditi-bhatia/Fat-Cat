## What did the team do last week?
In the last week, we completed the following tasks:



## What is the team going to do next week?
Next week, our primary focus will be on refactoring the code to implement design patterns into our game. We will be adding the command design pattern for when screens are changed/states are changed, the iterator pattern for the leaderboard display, the state pattern for the main character, the decorator pattern for the final score calculation, and the observer pattern for score capture. We will also be working together to fix the remaining bugs in the game and for changing the main character's anatomy once it collides with an unhealthy or healthy object.

**Aditi:** Implement command design pattern for state changes and screen changes, resolve "callback error" at end of game, resolve flashing screen at end of game, update leaderboard UI.

**Suhel:**  Implement iterator design pattern for the leaderboard display. 

**Dipro:**  Implement decorator pattern for final score calculation. 

**Arsh:**  Implement state pattern for main character, create and update new player levels. 

**Dishant:**  Work on updating the main character's anatomy at collisions, generate new textures.

## What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?


## Next meeting is scheduled for: Saturday, November 11th, 2017
