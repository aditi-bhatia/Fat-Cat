## What is the team going to do next week?
Next week, we will be continuing to work on our Features List and Detailed Specifications document. Additionally, we will be each be working on mock-up screens for portions of the game. These mock-ups will be in development throughout our project, as our requirements and design needs might change. Based on last week's research, we have picked our game engine to be MelonJS, and in the upcoming week, we will be installing and setting up the envrionment on our laptops. Each of us will also set up a demo game in order to experiment and become familiar with the environment.

If we have time, we will also begin the UML model and sequence diagrams for our application.

**Aditi:** Set up MelonJS environment, build a sample MelonJS project, work on Features document, decide on recommended design pattern, design 1-2 mock-up screens, and begin UML model/sequence diagrams.
